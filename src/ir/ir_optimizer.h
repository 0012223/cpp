/*
 * filename: ir_optimizer.h
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Header file for the IR optimization phase of the Ñ›++ compiler.
 * Defines the interface for optimizing the intermediate representation
 * to generate more efficient code.
 * 
 * Key Components:
 * - IrOptimizer struct: Maintains state during optimization passes
 * - ir_optimizer_init(): Initialize a new optimizer instance
 * - ir_optimize_program(): Entry point for optimizing an entire program
 * - ir_optimization_pass(): Apply a specific optimization technique
 * 
 * Interactions:
 * - Takes IR from ir.c as input
 * - Produces optimized IR for the code generator
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - All operations on WORD-sized values (architecture dependent)
 * - Implements standard optimizations like constant folding, dead code elimination
 * - Platform-independent optimizations only; architecture-specific optimizations 
 *   are handled in the code generation phase
